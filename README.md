# AI_Fruits_classifier_using_CNN

**PROBLEM Statament**: Build a CNN Based multi classifier to detect which type of fruits it is?

**Data Description** 

- Different numbers of pictures was click with the camera with diffrent angle like top view, front view, back view and with multiple rotation. And after that the images was resized and cropped accordinly. 
- Then we made folder for each particular categories and save the images accordinly. Then we label each of the folders to its categories name.

**Data Description**

There are two datasets:
- 1) Training dataset: Which consists of 9310 images belonging to 18 types of fruits such as Apple Braeburn, Apple Golden, Banana, etc
- 2) Testing dataset: Which consists of 3119 images belonging to same 18 classes.

**Model Building**
- We Build a simple CNN model which consists of 3 Convolutional layer with maxpooling layers and 2 Fully connected or Dense layers. Then we trained our model.
- On testing we are recieved 99.31% accuray on the training dataset and 99.11% accuracy on the testing dataset. which is very nice accuary.
